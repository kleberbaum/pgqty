Data requirements within your application are picked up automatically, freeing
you from having to maintain GraphQL queries by-hand. It offers a first-class
TypeScript experience. See API documentation at all times within autocomplete.

Make breaking changes to your API, and see type-errors exactly where things are
breaking, in realtime. No more running a separate validation step.

This repository is the **PGQty** fork of
[GQty](https://github.com/gqty-dev/gqty), published under the new `pgqty` and
`@pgqty/*` npm names for the [`pgqty`](https://www.npmjs.com/org/pgqty)
organization. It keeps the original developer experience while enabling tailored
workflows for Pylon and other server-side environments.
