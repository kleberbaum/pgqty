Data requirements within your application are picked up automatically, freeing
you from having to maintain GraphQL queries by-hand. It offers a first-class
TypeScript experience. See API documentation at all times within autocomplete.

Make breaking changes to your API, and see type-errors exactly where things are
breaking, in realtime. No more running a separate validation step.

Refer to this repository for the most up-to-date PGQty CLI guidance while the
forked documentation is being refreshed.
